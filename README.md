Notes on the paper: 

ERROR ESTIMATES FOR PHYSICS-INFORMED NEURAL
NETWORKS APPROXIMATING THE NAVIER-STOKES
EQUATIONS

1. Is there a way to mathematically define the "residual" concept of a PDE as in eqn (1.3)?
2. The residual idea serves a more abstract view of a weak solution
3. What is the state of the art of existence and uniqueness for NSE? Is there a way to connect convex integrated solutions of equations to neural network solutions
4.
